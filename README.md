# RecommendationEngineWebsite
This website is done using <b>Streamlit</b>.

There are two pickle files for this model to run. One is the <b>Movie_list.pkl</b> and the other one is <b>similarity.pkl</b>. Due to the upload limit of Github I have uploaded only the movie_list.pkl. 

First run the <b>movie_recommendation.ipynb</b> file to get the pickle files ready. 
Then after getting the models put it the folder of app.py and run the <b>app.py</b> file using the command <i>streamlit run app.py</i>

Finally you are ready with your recommendation engine.
